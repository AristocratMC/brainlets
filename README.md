brainlets.moe is a simple website where various guides, calculators, and general comments on Girls' Frontline can be found. This project is primarily a means of learning web development and as such will remain simple enough for fellow beginners to learn from. The project currently uses bootstrap, jQuery, and Django. The site is deployed on an Amazon EC2 instance using nginx and uWSGI. As it is very early in development, the tech stack may change at any time. The project is under the GNU General Public License v3.
