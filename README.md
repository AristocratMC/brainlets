# brainlets

[brainlets.moe](http://brainlets.moe) is a simple website that features a few tools for the mobile game known as Girls' Frontline. The key draw of this project is the [damage simulator](http://brainlets.moe/gf/sim/), a tool used by thousands of players across the world. The damage simulator aims to be user-friendly and up to date, all while attempting to be as accurate as a web-based simulator can be. As there are many other popular websites that feature other useful tools and guides for the game, the sim will remain the focus of project brainlets, as opposed to the development of other tools/pages.
